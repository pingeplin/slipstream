### Analysis of Existing Codebase

#### Current Google Drive File Download Implementation
-   **Class:** `GDriveClient` in `src/slipstream/integrations/gdrive.py`.
-   **Method:** `download_file(self, file_id, dest_path)` uses `googleapiclient.http.MediaIoBaseDownload`.
-   **State:** Synchronous and sequential. It uses `downloader.next_chunk()` in a `while` loop.

#### How Files are Currently Downloaded
-   In `src/slipstream/main.py`, the `process` command:
    1.  Lists files in the folder.
    2.  Iterates through the list of files in a `for` loop (lines 82-144).
    3.  For each file:
        -   Downloads it synchronously (`client.download_file`).
        -   Performs OCR synchronously (`ocr_engine.extract_text`).
        -   Performs LLM extraction (using `asyncio.run(extractor.extract_receipt_data(text))`).

#### Integration with CLI Pipeline
-   The pipeline follows: CLI (`typer`) -> GDrive Download -> OCR -> Anthropic API -> Output.
-   The entire loop is currently synchronous at the top level, even though individual LLM extractions use `asyncio.run`.

#### Existing Test Coverage
-   **Unit Tests:** `tests/unit/test_gdrive.py` covers `list_files` and `download_file` (with mocking).
-   **Integration Tests:** `tests/integration/test_gdrive_download.py` covers folder processing via CLI.

#### Dependencies and Error Handling
-   **Dependencies:** `google-api-python-client`, `typer`, `asyncio`.
-   **Error Handling:** `main.py` has a `try-except` block inside the loop, allowing the process to continue if one file fails ("Continue-on-error mode").

### TDD Refactoring Plan: Parallel GDrive Download

#### Goals
-   Refactor `GDriveClient` to support parallel downloads.
-   Update CLI to utilize parallel downloads.
-   Maintain backward compatibility and existing error handling logic.

#### Approach
We will use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelizing the `googleapiclient` calls, as they are I/O bound and the library itself is not natively `async`.

#### 1. Characterization Tests (Establish Current Behavior)
- [ ] Create `tests/unit/test_gdrive_parallel.py` to establish a baseline for multiple file downloads.
- [ ] Ensure existing integration tests pass before any changes. (Status: ✓)

#### 2. New Test Cases for Parallel Download
- [ ] **Test Case 1: Sequential Compatibility.** Verify `download_file` still works as before.
- [ ] **Test Case 2: Multi-file Download.** Add a new method `download_files(file_list, dest_dir)` and test it with multiple files (mocked).
- [ ] **Test Case 3: Error Handling.** Verify that if one download fails in `download_files`, others still complete or are handled correctly (mapping to the "continue-on-error" requirement).
- [ ] **Test Case 4: Thread Safety.** Ensure shared resources (like the `service` object) are used safely in a threaded environment.

#### 3. Refactoring Milestones

**Phase 1: Enhance `GDriveClient`**
- [ ] Update `GDriveClient` to accept an optional `max_workers` parameter.
- [ ] Implement `download_files(self, files: List[Dict], dest_dir: Path)` using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- [ ] Keep `download_file` as the atomic unit for a single download.

**Phase 2: Update CLI integration**
- [ ] Add `--workers` (`-w`) option to the `process` command in `src/slipstream/main.py`.
- [ ] Modify `src/slipstream/main.py` to use `client.download_files` instead of the manual `for` loop for downloading.
- [ ] *Note:* Initially, we might only parallelize the *downloading* part. OCR and LLM extraction are currently sequential in the loop. We should decide if we want to parallelize the *entire* per-file pipeline or just the download. Given the task description "refactor the existing Google Drive file download functionality... to support parallel downloads", we will focus on the download part first.

**Phase 3: Performance Validation**
- [ ] Add a script or test that compares sequential vs. parallel download time (with high latency simulation if needed).

#### 4. Validation & Rollback Strategy
- [ ] **Validation:** All unit and integration tests must pass.
- [ ] **Rollback:** If performance issues or thread-safety bugs arise, the `max_workers=1` setting (default) should restore sequential behavior. Git commits will be granular to allow easy reversion.

### Progress Tracking Checklist
- [ ] Phase 0: Setup and Baseline
    - [ ] Verify existing tests pass `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_gdrive.py` (Status: ✓)
    - [ ] Create `tests/unit/test_gdrive_parallel.py` with failing tests for `download_files`
- [ ] Phase 1: `GDriveClient` Refactoring
    - [ ] Implement `max_workers` in `GDriveClient.__init__`
    - [ ] Implement `GDriveClient.download_files`
    - [ ] Verify `download_files` unit tests pass
- [ ] Phase 2: CLI Integration
    - [ ] Add `--workers` option to CLI
    - [ ] Update `process` command to use `download_files`
    - [ ] Verify integration tests pass
- [ ] Phase 3: Final Validation
    - [ ] Run all tests and linting
    - [ ] Verify performance improvement (optional/manual)

### Step-by-Step Implementation Steps

1.  **Preparation:**
    -   Create `./plans/2512.0008_enhance_gdrive_download_performance.md` (this plan).
    -   Verify current tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_gdrive.py`.

2.  **TDD - Step 1 (Fail):**
    -   Add `test_download_multiple_files_parallel` to `tests/unit/test_gdrive.py`. It should attempt to call `client.download_files`.

3.  **Refactor - Step 1 (Pass):**
    -   Implement `download_files` in `GDriveClient` using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

4.  **TDD - Step 2 (Fail):**
    -   Add test for error handling in `download_files`.

5.  **Refactor - Step 2 (Pass):**
    -   Ensure `download_files` handles exceptions per file and returns a summary of successes/failures.

6.  **TDD - Step 3 (Integration):**
    -   Update `tests/integration/test_gdrive_download.py` if necessary to verify parallel behavior (though integration tests are high-level).

7.  **Refactor - Step 3 (CLI):**
    -   Integrate `download_files` into `src/slipstream/main.py`.
